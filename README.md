## **Overview**

The **Tea Subscription API** is a backend application built with Ruby on Rails. It enables customers to manage subscriptions for weekly, monthly, or yearly tea plans. Each subscription includes details about teas, such as brewing instructions and temperatures, and customers can activate or cancel subscriptions seamlessly.

This API was developed with a clean structure, leveraging ActiveRecord for ORM and RSpec for testing. All controllers and models are thoroughly tested without the use of external gems like FactoryBot or Faker.

## **Database Schema**

### **Tables and Relationships**

- **Subscriptions**:  
  Subscriptions belong to a customer and have many teas through a join table.

- **Teas**:  
  Teas are included in multiple subscriptions through a join table.

**Example Schema Structure:**
```ruby
create_table "customers" do |t|
  t.string "first_name"
  t.string "last_name"
  t.string "email"
  t.string "address"
end

create_table "subscriptions" do |t|
  t.string "title"
  t.decimal "price"
  t.string "status"
  t.string "frequency"
  t.bigint "customer_id"
end

create_table "teas" do |t|
  t.string "title"
  t.text "description"
  t.integer "temperature"
  t.integer "brew_time"
end
```

## **Testing**

- All models and controllers are thoroughly tested using **RSpec**.
- Tests validate:
- Model validations (e.g., presence, numericality).
- Controller responses (e.g., successful retrieval, error handling).
- No external testing gems like FactoryBot or Faker were used.

To run tests:
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

## **Technologies Used**

- **Ruby (v3.2.2)**: Programming language.
- **Ruby on Rails**: Framework for building the backend.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for managing persistent data.
- **RSpec**: Testing framework for unit and integration tests.
- **JSON:API Serializer**: For rendering data in a JSON:API-compliant format.
